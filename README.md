# A glimpse of my projects
I started my journey through the marvels of software and coding in September 2021. I am fascinated with scalability and can keep adding and improving features efficiently, and of course, I ensure that I can keep doing it. For this, I apply concepts such as modularity, object-oriented design, loose coupling, high cohesion, etc.

I am listing most of the projects that are worth showing. I have plenty of them; the ones I did as assignments at college, there are those I did to keep brainstorming and acquiring ideas on some of my employers' tasks, some personal projects that I did to enjoy my other passion (video games), improve my skills to stay fit either for more personal projects or further employability or to demonstrate that I can do it.

I keep most of my College projects private because of integrity policies from my college; my professors previously approved the ones I show. I can permit access by invitation or walkthrough to potential employers by request. It is the same with some projects I have side-worked to gather ideas from my employer's tasks; I will certainly not show the lasts mentioned.

I will keep growing my list as I finish them and feel it is good enough to show. I will release some of my college work as I contact my professors with positive permission to disclose them to the world.

Below is the list of my projects classified by general use case or platform:
